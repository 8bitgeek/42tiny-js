This project aims to be an extremely simple JavaScript interpreter, meant for inclusion in applications that require a simple, familiar script language that can be included with no dependencies other than normal C++ libraries.

I make absolutely no guarantees that this is compliant to JavaScript/EcmaScript standard. In fact I am sure it isn't.

However the goal of this fork is it and i'm trying my best, to make's compliant as possible.

I'm welcome suggestions for changes that will bring it closer to compliancy or useful test cases to add to the test suite.

This is a fork of the nice [tiny-js project](https://github.com/gfwilliams/tiny-js)  from the [Pur3 Ltd.](http://www.pur3.co.uk/)

At this point: many thanks to Mr.Williams for his nice Project (the basics for this fork).
